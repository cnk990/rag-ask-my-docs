Security Policy

The security of our companyâ€™s data, systems, and physical premises is critical.
This policy outlines guidelines and mandatory practices to ensure a secure working environment.

Password Requirements:
All employees must create strong passwords consisting of at least twelve (12) characters,
including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
Passwords must be changed every ninety (90) days. Employees are prohibited from reusing previous passwords.

Multi-Factor Authentication:
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for accessing all company systems, including email,
cloud services, and administrative tools. Employees must enroll their devices and follow the MFA prompts during login.

Data Classification:
Company data is classified into three categories: Confidential, Internal Use Only, and Public.
Employees must handle confidential data with utmost care and only share it with authorized personnel. Data labeled Internal Use Only should not be disclosed outside the company.

Email Security:
Employees must not open email attachments or click links from unknown sources.
Suspicious emails should be reported to the IT Security team immediately. Sensitive information must not be shared via email unless encrypted.

Device Security:
All company laptops, desktops, and mobile devices must be secured with passwords or biometric authentication.
Devices should be locked when unattended. Employees should not install unauthorized software on company devices.

Remote Work Guidelines:
When working remotely, employees must use secure, company-approved VPN connections.
Sensitive conversations should not take place in public spaces. All devices used remotely should comply with company security standards.

Incident Reporting:
Any security incident, suspected breach, or loss of data must be reported to the IT Security team immediately.
Prompt reporting helps mitigate potential risks.

Physical Security:
Access to company premises is controlled via ID badges. Visitors must sign in and be escorted at all times.
Employees must ensure sensitive documents are secured in locked cabinets when not in use.

Failure to adhere to security policies may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
